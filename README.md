**Arm Manipulation using UR10e (in progress)**

Inside /src, these are descriptions of the packages:
- ur_description - Contains URDF xacros and meshes.
- ur_simulation - Contains launch files for rviz, ignition and moveit configurations
- ur_moveit_config - Contains config files generated by MoveIt Setup Assistant
- ur_control - Haven't added anything yet, but it supposed to contain the controllers for describing the trapezoidal velocity profile between two waypoints.
